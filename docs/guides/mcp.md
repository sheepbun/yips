# MCP Integration

MCP client integration is intentionally **not** being pursued in Yips.

## Status

- Decision: rejected
- Date: 2026-02-25
- Reason: product direction chose to avoid MCP dependency and complexity

## Impact

- The roadmap item for MCP has been marked skipped.
- Yips continues to focus on native tools and direct integrations.
