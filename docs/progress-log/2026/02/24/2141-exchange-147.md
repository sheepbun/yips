Summary: Updated roadmap and docs to explicitly skip MCP integration by product decision.
Changed:

- Updated `docs/roadmap.md`:
  - marked Milestone 3 MCP item as skipped (`~~...~~`) and checked off to prevent future scheduling
  - added Decision Log entry: `MCP integration` with status `Rejected`
- Replaced `docs/guides/mcp.md` content with a short status note documenting MCP rejection and rationale/date.
- Updated `docs/README.md` guide map description for MCP to indicate it is intentionally skipped.

Validation:

- Docs-only change; no code/test commands were required.

Next:

- Continue Milestone 3 work on remaining unchecked item: `Skills: search, fetch, build, todos, virtual terminal`.
